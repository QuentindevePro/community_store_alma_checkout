# Community Store Alma Checkout
[Alma](https://almapay.com) Checkout payment add-on for Community Store for Concrete CMS

Requires version 2.5+ of Community Store.

## Setup
Install Community Store First.

Download a 'release' zip of the add-on, unzip this to the packages folder of your Concrete CMS install (alongside the community_store folder) and install via the dashboard.

Once installed, configure the payment method through the Settings/Payments dashboard section for 'Store'. 
You will need to log into Alma's Dashboard, and through the Developers section copy in test and live API Keys.

## Missing features

This package is still very young and therefore needs many improvements:

- Front-end to give user possibility to set desired installments count
- i18n (currently a mix of French and English)
- Better UI/UX
